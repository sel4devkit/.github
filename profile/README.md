## Introduction

The [seL4 Microkernel](https://sel4.systems) is a technology of increasing interest and has potential to deliver significant benefit across a range of applications requiring strong domain separation and software-enforced, trusted execution environments.

seL4 is formally verified software and offers significant benefits over other software-based implementations in terms of the assurance and trust that can be gained. It is open source COTS technology, and the potential for reduced cost for high assurance products and reduced time to market are significant.

Developing on top of the seL4 microkernel is currently complex, time-consuming, and has a potentially steep barrier to entry. This developer kit is targeted at reducing this barrier to entry for using (i.e., developing on top of) the seL4 technology and increasing the number of people that can cost-effectively adopt seL4 in their products and tech stacks.
